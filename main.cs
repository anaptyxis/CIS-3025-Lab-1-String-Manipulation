         * 1. Ask for a sentence or phrase, and store as string variable named phrase.
         * 2. Write the following to the console. Label each output:
         *    a. The original string
         *    b. The string in all lowercase characters
         *    c. The string in all uppercase characters
         *    d. All of the words in the string, each on its own line ending with a comma. 
         *       (You can assume that no punctuation occurs in the phrase.)
         *    e. Whether or not the phrase is a palindrome.s Do not consider spaces or 
         *       upper- vs. lowercase when checking for palindromes.
         *    f. The string sorted so that a < b < etc. This can be case sensitive, so:
         *       "Northern Vermont University" --> "  NUVeeehiimnnnoorrrrstttvy"
         *       
         * PART II
         * 3. Ask for a character, and store as an uppercase char named originalChar. If multiple
         *    characters are entered, just use the first.
         * 4. Ask for an offset (an integer between 0 and 25, inclusive.)
         * 5. Rotate the character by the offset. So, if the original character is 'A' and the
         *    offset is 2, the rotated character is 'C'. However, is the original character is
         *    'Z', then the rotated character would be 'B'. Name this rotatedChar.
         * 6. Write the following to the console. Label each output:
         *    a. The original character, the offset, and the rotated character in the format:
         *       "orignalChar rotated by offset is rotatedChar."
